ToDo: Make gimmicky website

### Credits

Color palettes have been provided by [u/marinemotion](https://www.reddit.com/user/marinemotion/)

## Building the pages

The solution is slightly hacky, but hey it works
The repository serves the `docs` folder, there are no docs - sorry.

```sh
make build # contains custom domain
```
