ToDo: Make gimmicky website

I have tried to keep most things customizable - for most parts.

* Custom themes
* Switch language for your name (maybe extend to whole site? Too much?)

### Credits

Color palettes have been provided by [u/marinemotion](https://www.reddit.com/user/marinemotion/)

## Development

```
npm run start
```

## Building the pages

The solution is hacky, but it works.
The repository serves the `docs` folder, there are no docs - sorry.

```sh
make build # contains custom domain
```
